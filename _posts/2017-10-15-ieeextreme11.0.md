## Overview
Great results for the first participation in the IEEEXtreme Programming Competition 2017, 11th edition of the no-stop 24h programming competition. More than 8000 participants, for a total of almost 3350 teams.
Lorenzo Nodari, Michele Dusi, Claudio Cito, Francesco Cremascoli, Daniele Vezzoli, Stefano Poma and Nicola Onofri are the 7 students who have competed for 24h in a row, bringing the University of Brescia to the podium!

## How have we reach this goal?
In February, the IEEE Brescia Student Branch launched a programming activity for first-year Computer Engineering students. Intent on acquiring object-oriented programming bases, the 21 participants of the "Programma Arnaldo" have deepened the management of algorithms, data structures and research methods. 
It was structured into two phases: Paris and Zurich.

### "Paris" phase
During the first "Paris" phase, the candidates planned in groups emulating the conditions of the competition, facing problems of increasing difficulty. On several occasions, each team was able to reach a level of competitiveness and preparation, producing well-documented software (UML, case study), functioning in the time allowed.

In addition to the shortage of time, each team had no previous programming experience: none of the 21 candidates programmed in other competitions or had work experience in the programming sector; the one and only accumulated programming experience comes from the lessons held in the classroom.
An additional factor to be managed, given that the programming of algorithms follows precise mental schemes defined by the experience of the programmer himself.

At the end of the "Paris" phase, 5 candidates chose to retire and the remaining 16 chose to face the Test July 17 MTA classroom to enter the "Phase Zurich‚Äù.

### "Zurich" phase
The second phase "Zurich" was proposed to only 6 candidates who have successfully passed the "Paris" phase. Onofri Nicola, trainer during the "Paris" phase, leads the 6 cadets with 10 two-hour meetings, held over the weekend. 

Programming challenges from Hackerrank have been faced outside the academic hours by the group of students, who came in contact with issues of a completely different level and degree of challenge.
The elaboration of different strategies compared to what was seen in the classroom, pushed the 7 students to expand the methods of implementation and planning: a further added value based on the validity of the academic courses.

## Results
All participating teams from Italy reached a position above the third quartile, result that confirms and quantifies the real potential and capacity of Italian students, Italian universities and the quality of the courses provided.
Throughout Italy, the University of Brescia has reached the third place among the participating universities, experimenting for the first time in its history the preparation of first-year undergraduate students in computer engineering for the IEEE world programming competition.
Given the results, we intend to continue proposing the "Programma Arnaldo" in the coming years.
