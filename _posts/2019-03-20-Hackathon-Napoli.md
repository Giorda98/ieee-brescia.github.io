## MetroInd4.0&IoT
MetroInd4.0&IoT aims to discuss the contributions both of the metrology for the development of Industry 4.0 and IoT and the new opportunities offered by Industry 4.0 and IoT for the development of new measurement methods and apparatus. MetroInd4.0&IoT aims to gather people who work in developing instrumentation and measurement methods for Industry 4.0 and IoT. Attention is paid, but not limited to, new technology for metrology-assisted production in Industry 4.0 and IoT, Industry 4.0 and IoT component measurement, sensors and associated signal conditioning for Industry 4.0 and IoT, and calibration methods for electronic test and measurement for Industry 4.0 and IoT.
